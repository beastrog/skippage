# Skip Selection Page Redesign

## Overview
This project is a redesign of the skip size selection page for a waste management service. The goal was to create a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface while maintaining the existing functionality.

## Features
- Responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop
- Clean UI with a focus on usability
- Real-time data fetching from the API
- Clear visual feedback for user selections
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for user actions

## Technical Approach

### Architecture
The application follows a component-based architecture using React and TypeScript. The main components are:

1. **Index.tsx**: The main page that handles data fetching and error states
2. **SkipSelectionPage.tsx**: The container component for the skip selection interface
3. **SkipCard.tsx**: Reusable card component for each skip option
4. **LoadingSpinner.tsx**: Component shown during data loading

### State Management
- React's built-in useState hook is used for component-level state management
- The selected skip state is managed in the SkipSelectionPage component

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- shadcn/ui components for consistent UI elements
- Responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes

### Data Fetching
- Data is fetched from the API endpoint using the Fetch API
- Loading states are displayed during data retrieval
- Error handling for failed API requests with user-friendly messages

### User Experience Improvements
- Clear visual indication of the selected skip
- Toast notifications for user actions
- Warning labels for skips not allowed on roads
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Disabled "Continue" button until a selection is made

## Future Improvements
- Add filtering options for skip sizes
- Implement more detailed skip information
- Add comparison feature for different skip sizes
- Improve accessibility features
- Add unit and integration tests

## How to Use
1. Load the page to see available skip options
2. Click on a skip card to select that size
3. Click "Continue" to proceed with your selection
4. Use the "Back" button to return to the previous page
